Know which of your rooms are occupied in real-time.  Find space for meetings or studying, locate people in an emergency, tie into a building automation system.  Perkinsense nodes were originally designed to identify empty study rooms in Duke's library, Perkins.

This project consists of the firmware running on the nodes, the hardware design, and the simple scripts managing the backend.
